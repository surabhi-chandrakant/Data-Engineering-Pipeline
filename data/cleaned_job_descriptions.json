yes8. supportive environment. we donât operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. everyone wants you to be successful â internal politics are at a minimum here.9. lots of raises. we do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you dont have to ask for one. its not unusual at all for someone to receive 2 raises per year.10. weâll invest in your training. we want you and everyone to get better constantly. youâll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your systemwork process, and just generally try to make your life easier.11. 4-6 weeks vacation. we 100 want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.12. paid maternitypaternity leave. weâve even started letting people skip meetings during labor!13. self-funded so we can do whatâs right for us. we donât have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.--what are your companyâs values?--see here: those are legitimately our values. the careers page is definitely worth checking out - itâs not just normal corporate bs. we promise youâll learn a lot about us.--ok, so iâve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. will you tell me what the actual job is?--no.--wait... what?--ok fiiine.helping to make our social media presence 1000x less shitty by being a reply guy, shitposting, responding to comments on our posts, and doing whatever else you can to create raving fans of our brands (witty yeti will be your primary project at the start).we are very early in our social media explorationdevelopment and what we are doing now isnât enough. we want to absolutely crush, and need your knowledge and sense of humor to help get there.youâre gonna be tasked with pulling all the levers you reasonably can to grow our social media - weâre not expecting you to make videos yourself (unless you want to), but want you to shitpost and comment and help with creative ideation (letâs hop on this trend real quick, this meme would be hilarious, etc).youâre basically gonna be a social media generalist - doing whatever is necessary (within reason, of course) to help us be successful in reaching the peopleâ. maybe itâs updating our page, maybe itâs making some thumbnails (we can teach you), maybe itâs responding with the perfect gif, maybe itâs crafting new copy pasta for someone who tweeted the most ridiculous thing youâve ever heard.weâll see how it shakes out and very much want to set you up for success, and the right strategy will require your input before we set anything in stone. weâll likely just feel our way through trying to find the thing(s) that work.like everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.--do i need experience?--we expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120 preferred).oh, you havent lived two lifetimes eating and breathing business 247365? who tf do you think you are, reading this job description? you absolute buffoon.oh, you havent been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) world wars? youre not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you sentient potato.oh, you didnt observe the big bang as it happened? get out of here, you pirated copy of windows 95.i might throw up from your arrogance. the hubris to think that you, an absolute fool, could apply for a social media job... sickening. iâm literally shaking right now.also, no you dont need any experience.we want special people, and donât give af what their background is. most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if youve never done anything like this before, dont sweat it. we hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge.the big bang requirement still stands though.--do i need a college degree?--you just need to be awesome.--are there any geographic restrictions?--as long as you are in a country that doesnât have active sanctions from the us government, we are interested. our founder isnât known for respecting the government much, but they have all the guns, soâ--what are your social media accounts?--this will give you an idea of what weâre currently doing: know a ton about social media but havenât ârunâ it before--as long as you are willing to learn (from others because we have no clue what weâre doing), then youâll be fine. we have lots of people in the company who never did their role before and we just paid them to learn, and now they do great.--this sounds pretty good, though iâm still skeptical that this isnât a pyramid scheme.--you sound just like the tax authorities!--that doesnât resolve any of my fears, but what do i need to do to apply?--please submit your information on the following page to apply. we promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is no.there will be multiple steps in this process, fyi, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. im sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.once youâre in our pipeline though, i would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. we definitely donât want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you âyesâ or ânoâ, and to not just ghost you (like everybody i match with on tinder).thank you for your time and interest, and i hope we can work together soon!please mention the word advocates and tag rmjqwoto0mgmyojeym2u6zgm1nzpkmtliojk5n2m6ogvjndoxyzjm when applying to show you read the job post completely (rmjqwoto0mgmyojeym2u6zgm1nzpkmtliojk5n2m6ogvjndoxyzjm). this is a beta feature to avoid spam applicants. companies can search these words to find applicants that read this and see theyre human.",
