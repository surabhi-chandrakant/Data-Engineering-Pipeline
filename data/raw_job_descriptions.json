You Can Be Yourself. You donât have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged), and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">2. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesnât matter what your credentials are â it matters what you get done.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">3. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we donât care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, weâre happy campers.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">4. Complete Work/Life Balance. If youâre routinely working more than 45ish hours, youâre gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">6. No Micro-Management. Once youâre trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably arenât the place for you.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">7. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could it really be? [Yes]</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">8. Supportive Environment. We donât operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful â internal politics are at a minimum here.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">9. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">10. Weâll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. Youâll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">11. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">12. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. Weâve even started letting people skip meetings during labor!</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">13. Self-Funded So We Can Do Whatâs Right for Us. We donât have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">--What are your companyâs values?--</p><p dir=\"ltr\">See here: <a href=\"http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\">http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/</a></p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - itâs not just normal corporate BS. We promise youâll learn a lot about us.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">--OK, so Iâve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--</p><p dir=\"ltr\">No.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">--Wait... What?--</p><p dir=\"ltr\">OK fiiine.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Helping to make our social media presence 1000x less shitty by being a reply guy, shitposting, responding to comments on our posts, and doing whatever else you can to create raving fans of our brands (<a href=\"https://www.wittyyeti.com/\">Witty Yeti</a> will be your primary project at the start).</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">We are very early in our social media exploration/development and what we are doing now isnât enough. We want to absolutely crush, and need your knowledge and sense of humor to help get there.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Youâre gonna be tasked with pulling all the levers you reasonably can to grow our social media - weâre not expecting you to make videos yourself (unless you want to), but want you to shitpost and comment and help with creative ideation (letâs hop on this trend real quick, this meme would be hilarious, etc).</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Youâre basically gonna be a social media generalist - doing whatever is necessary (within reason, of course) to help us be successful in reaching The Peopleâ¢. Maybe itâs updating our page, maybe itâs making some thumbnails (we can teach you), maybe itâs responding with the perfect GIF, maybe itâs crafting new copy pasta for someone who tweeted the most ridiculous thing youâve ever heard.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Weâll see how it shakes out and very much want to set you up for success, and the right strategy will require your input before we set anything in stone. Weâll likely just feel our way through trying to find the thing(s) that work.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Like everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">--Do I need experience?--</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Oh, you haven't lived two lifetimes eating and breathing business 24/7/365? Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute buffoon.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Oh, you haven't been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) World Wars? You're not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you sentient potato.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Oh, you didn't observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you pirated copy of Windows 95.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">I might throw up from your arrogance. The hubris to think that you, an absolute fool, could apply for a social media job... sickening. Iâm literally shaking right now.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Also, no you don't need any experience.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">We want special people, and donât give AF what their background is. Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if you've never done anything like this before, don't sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Big Bang requirement still stands though.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">--Do I need a college degree?--</p><p dir=\"ltr\">You just need to be awesome.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">--Are there any geographic restrictions?--</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As long as you are in a country that doesnât have active sanctions from the US government, we are interested. Our founder isnât known for respecting the government much, but they have all the guns, soâ¦</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">--What are your social media accounts?--</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This will give you an idea of what weâre currently doing:</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@wittyyeti.com\">https://www.tiktok.com/@wittyyeti.com</a></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/witty.yeti/\">https://www.instagram.com/witty.yeti/</a></p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">--I know a ton about social media but havenât ârunâ it before--</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As long as you are willing to learn (from others because we have no clue what weâre doing), then youâll be fine. We have lots of people in the company who never did their role before and we just paid them to learn, and now they do great.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">--This sounds pretty good, though Iâm still skeptical that this isnât a pyramid scheme.--</p><p dir=\"ltr\">You sound just like the tax authorities!</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">--That doesnât resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Once youâre in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely donât want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you âyesâ or ânoâ, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!</p><br/><br/>Please mention the word **ADVOCATES** and tag RMjQwOTo0MGMyOjEyM2U6ZGM1NzpkMTliOjk5N2M6OGVjNDoxYzJm when applying to show you read the job post completely (#RMjQwOTo0MGMyOjEyM2U6ZGM1NzpkMTliOjk5N2M6OGVjNDoxYzJm).
